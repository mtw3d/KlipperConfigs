### DO NOT EDIT THE SAMPLE CONFIG FILE!!! ###
#############################################
# By doing it this way, you will be able to automatically update to the 
# latest config & macros by just running:
#
# > ~/update_mtw_configs
#
# This will automatically download the newest versions of all other files. 
# Be sure to update Klipper in the Fluidd UI after updating your configs, 
# as the configs change between versions. 

# If you wish to make any changes to the default configs, copy the relevant 
# sections here. You only need to copy the lines that you are changing.
# For example, if you wanted to change to use a different extruder that 
# had a different rotation distance, you would create a new block with only:

# [extruder1] 
# rotation_distance: *whatever*

# Any settings set later in the load process will override settings set earlier,
# So changes in this file will override those in the sample config. 

# If for some reason you do want to make large-scale changes to the sample config, 
# just rename it to a new file name and update the include. This will prevent your 
# new file from being overwritten by the update process.
